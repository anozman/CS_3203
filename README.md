# CS 3203 Software Engineering 

This code was developed for CS 3203 Software engineering course at the University of Oklahoma. Within this code there are a couple of projects/assignments that are compiled into this single repo.

Note: Not all of the code in this repository may be refined, which will hopefully be changed at a later date

## Assignment 1

In this assignment, we were instructed to create a REST API using Node.js. Using a JSON file as the data to manipulate, we created GET, POST, PUT, DELETE commands. Front end created to interact with the API using basiic forms provided by HTML5

SEE CS_ASSIGNMENT2 for a more detailed README file

## Project Playbook

This was the course project that was designed by myself and a partner. This code is itentical to the original repo, found here:
https://github.com/lukefron/CS-3203-PROJECT-PLAYBOOK.git

One thing I wanted to touch on was the nws-api demo found under the 'static' directory. A feature that we had not been able to implement was for the website was creating our own analytics, one such variable that we wanted to include was the use of weather forecasts in our data. The NWS API included temperature, wind, overcast/precip for a given coordinate within the US. This demo API explores obtaining some of these variables using Node.js for a given location, location and forecast time, and range of forecast hours.

The newsScraper.ipynb is a demo of a feature used in the web application to populate news articles at the bottom of the feed, adding to the "all-in-one" design goal of the project

Finally the docker file was to give us experience with deploying our projects to Docker.
